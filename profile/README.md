# Two Hours One Life

A fork of the Open Source game One Hour One Life.
Otherwise known as 2HOL, we're made by and for the community.

## We need your help!
If you're reading this, you likely have some technical or industry experience.

Our core codebase is C++ mixed with PHP, but it's our smaller applications and general organisation that we need the most assitance with.

If you can spare a few hours a week, join the Discord and make yourself known, ideally becoming somewhat involved in the community.

You can claim an issue yourself or ask for direction on what needs priority.
